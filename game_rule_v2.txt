Felix: The Cat in the Sack is a 4-player auction game. Each player has 15 tokens and an identical set of 10 cards at the beginning of the game. The game consists of 10 rounds. Each round has two stages, the Selling Stage and the Bidding Stage. At the Selling Stage, each player plays one card from the hand and faces down into Central Area. At the Bidding Stage, the first card in the Central Area is revealed, then players take turns to bid for the cards using their tokens. The player either increases his/her bid or quits the bid in their turn. If a player choose to quit, he/she reveals a card in the Central Area, takes back his/her betting tokens and receives a certain amount of reward which depends on how many players have already quitted the bid at that time. The last player remained in the Bidding Stage wins the bid and purchase the cards, after which the game proceeds to the next round. 

The card set includes ¡°+15 Cat¡±, ¡°+11 Cat¡±, ¡°+8 Cat¡±, ¡°+5 Cat¡±, ¡°+3 Cat¡±, ¡°0 Cat¡±, ¡°-5 Cat¡±, ¡°-8 Cat¡±, ¡°Big Dog¡±, and ¡°Small Dog¡±. A ¡°Cat¡± card is worth the same score as specified in its name. For instance, a ¡°+15 Cat¡± is worth 15 points. The ¡°Dog¡± cards are worth no points and have special effects. The ¡°Big Dog¡± removes the ¡°Cat¡± card with the highest value and a ¡°Small Dog¡± removes the ¡°Cat¡± card with the lowest value. For instance, a player who wins the bid for ¡°+15 Cat¡±, ¡°+8 Cat¡±, ¡°-5 Cat¡± and ¡°Big Dog¡± actually gets ¡°+8 Cat¡± and ¡°-5 Cat¡± only, which are worth 13 points in total, since the ¡°Big Dog¡± removes the ¡°+15 Cat¡±. 

At the end of the game, player with the highest score is the winner.
